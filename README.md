## NOTE
_See my updated 2020 version of this project: **[christmas-v2](https://github.com/zane-programs/christmas-v2)**_

My fun, poorly-written Christmas project that I made at 2 AM. By popular demand, I am posting this project on GitHub.

By the way, I did not include my WAV files in this repository for copyright purposes. Enjoy!
